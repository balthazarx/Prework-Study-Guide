# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

- My motivation to finish this project has lead me to find a better path to grow my portfolio as well as learn new tools.
- Building this project was to help me understand the different process each developer goes through when coding. There is plenty still to learn about coding in general.
- Creating this website solves the problem of going into the bootcamp with a little knowledge rather than none at all. It is always great to know what the bootcamp is going to offer.
- Currently I do not know much about coding, although this bootcamp has taught me the process and flow of a developer. The different tools used when created a website is very amazing to me. I strive to learn more about coding and get better.
